<p>My name is Jyotsna, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) 
from Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT). With a strong foundation in academics, I successfully cracked 
the JEE Advanced examination and secured a seat at IIT BHU. However, my keen interest in the CSAI program led me 
to choose NSUT, where I believe I can better align my education with my career aspirations.</p>

<p>From a young age, I have been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform our world. This passion
 drove me to dive deep into various programming languages and technologies. At NSUT, I am actively learning Web 
 development, Python, C++, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. Each of these skills is crucial for 
 my goal of becoming proficient in both software development and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Web development has allowed me to understand the intricacies of creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces. 
Python, with its versatility, has been instrumental in my journey through data analysis and machine learning.
Meanwhile, mastering C++ and DSA has strengthened my problem-solving abilities and helped me write more efficient 
and optimized code. I enjoy the process of coding and find great satisfaction in overcoming challenges and building
efficient solutions.</p>

<p>My decision to focus on CSAI was driven by my interest in artificial intelligence and its applications. The 
curriculum at NSUT provides me with the opportunity to explore various AI concepts, including machine learning, 
natural language processing, and computer vision. I am eager to apply this knowledge to real-world problems and 
contribute to innovative projects that can make a significant impact.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
I believe that combining my technical skills with my drive for excellence will enable me to make meaningful 
contributions to the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. I am excited about the future and look 
forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
